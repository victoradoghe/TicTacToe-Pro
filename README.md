##  Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd TicTacToe
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:5173` to play the game!

##  How to Play

### Basic Rules
1. The game is played on a 3√ó3 grid
2. Players take turns placing X's and O's
3. First player to get 3 marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins
4. If all 9 squares are filled and no player has won, it's a draw

### Game Controls
- **Click** on any empty cell to make your move
- ** New Round**: Start a new game with the same settings
- ** Reset Scores**: Clear the scoreboard
- ** Back to Menu**: Return to mode selection

##  AI Implementation

### Easy Bot
- Makes completely random moves
- Great for beginners and casual play

### Hard Bot
- **Win Detection**: Takes winning moves when available
- **Block Detection**: Prevents player from winning
- **Strategic Positioning**: Prefers center and corners
- **Fallback**: Random moves when no strategy applies

### Advanced Bot
- **Minimax Algorithm**: Uses game theory for optimal play
- **Depth-based Scoring**: Prioritizes quicker wins and slower losses
- **Perfect Play**: Impossible to beat, will always win or draw
- **Efficient Pruning**: Optimized for fast decision making

##  Styling Features

### Visual Design
- **Gradient Backgrounds**: Beautiful purple-blue gradients
- **Glass Morphism**: Semi-transparent containers with blur effects
- **Smooth Animations**: Cell appearances, winning celebrations, hover effects
- **Responsive Typography**: Scalable text for all screen sizes

### Animations
- **Cell Placement**: Rotating scale animation when placing X/O
- **Winning Combination**: Pulsing glow effect for winning cells
- **Bot Thinking**: Subtle pulse animation while AI calculates
- **Hover Effects**: Lift and glow effects on interactive elements

##  Responsive Design

The game automatically adapts to different screen sizes:

- **Desktop**: Full-featured layout with side-by-side elements
- **Tablet**: Stacked layout with optimized button sizes
- **Mobile**: Compact design with touch-friendly controls

### Breakpoints
- **768px and below**: Mobile/tablet optimizations
- **480px and below**: Extra compact mobile layout

##  Game Logic

### Win Detection
```javascript
const WINNING_COMBINATIONS = [
  [0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8], // Rows
  [0, 3, 6], [1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 8], // Columns
  [0, 4, 8], [2, 4, 6] // Diagonals
]
```

### Minimax Algorithm
The advanced AI uses the minimax algorithm to evaluate all possible game states and choose the optimal move. The algorithm:
1. Evaluates all possible moves recursively
2. Assumes both players play optimally
3. Scores positions based on win/loss/draw outcomes
4. Includes depth preference for faster wins

##  Available Scripts
